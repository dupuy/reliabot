## Asking a question

> 💡 If you have a Reliabot question, take a look at the [README][2] and its
> [FAQ][3] to see if it's answered there.

Before asking a question, search for [existing issues][4] that are similar. If
you find a relevant issue but still need clarification, ask your question in
that issue. A few internet search queries may also turn up an answer quickly.

If you don't find an answer or an existing issue, follow these steps to ask
your question:

- [Create a new issue][5], labeling it as a 🟣 **question**.
- Provide as much context as you can for your question.
  - Reliabot version
  - Whether you're running Reliabot with pre-commit or on the command line
  - Operating System (distribution) and Python versions
- Explain what you're trying to do, and what you don't understand.

Someone should respond to the issue as soon as possible. Be patient. 🕗😊

## Reporting problems

### Before submitting a problem report

A good problem report shouldn't force others to contact you for critical
missing information. Please investigate carefully, find examples and
counter-examples, and describe the problem in detail. Completing the following
steps in advance helps to fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- To see if other users have experienced (and perhaps already solved) your
  problem, search the [bug tracker][6] for similar issues or error messages.
- Searching the internet (especially Stack Overflow) can help you find any
  users of other tools, or in other forums, who have run into a similar
  problem.
- Make sure you are using the latest Reliabot version.
- Confirm that your problem is really a bug and not an error on your part, such
  as using Reliabot with unsupported environments or versions. Reading the
  [documentation][2] can help. If you need help, consider just
  [asking a question](#asking-a-question) first.
- Collect information about the problem:
  - Specific Reliabot command line and context.
  - Reliabot output, including error messages, warnings, and stack traces.
    Setting `PYTHONWARNINGS=default` in the environment can show extra
    diagnostics.
  - Your `.pre-commit-config.yml`, `dependabot.yml`, and `.gitignore` files.
  - If your GitHub repository is private, output from `tree` or `ls -R`.
  - Versions of Reliabot, Python, and your Operating System (distribution).
  - Output from `reliabot.py --self-test` (if relevant).
  - Can you reliably reproduce the problem? And can you also reproduce it with
    older Reliabot versions?

### How to submit a good problem report

> ⚠️Don't report security related issues or vulnerabilities, or include
> sensitive information in reports on the issue tracker, or elsewhere in
> public. Instead, [open a draft security advisory][7] and provide the
> vulnerability information there. See the [Reliabot security policy][8] for
> more details.

The Reliabot project uses [GitHub issues][4] for tracking bugs. If you found a
problem using Reliabot:

- [Create an issue using the problem template][9]. It may not be clear yet
  whether it's a bug, so please don't label the issue.
- Describe the behavior you expect and the differences in the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction
  steps* that others can follow to recreate the issue. This may include your
  GitHub repository, probably its `pre-commit-config.yaml`, and definitely your
  `dependabot.yml` file.
- For the best problem reports and fastest fixes, try to isolate the problem
  and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.
- If you would like to develop a fix for the problem, or already have a
  proposed change, please mention this in the problem report.

Once you have created the issue:

- Someone reviews it, labeling the issue with one of these:
  - 🔴 **bug** – if it's really a Reliabot bug or error
  - ⚪️ **duplicate** – if there's already an issue for this
  - 🔵 **enhancement** – if Reliabot works as intended, but could work better
  - 🔵 **help wanted** – if they aren't sure what to label it
  - ⚪️ **invalid** if this is spam or nonsense or not even a question
  - 🟣 **question** – if it's not a bug, and you should do something differently
  - ⚪️ **wontfix** – if Reliabot is working as intended, and won't change
- They try to reproduce the problem using your provided steps. If there are no
  steps or obvious way to reproduce it, they may ask you for those steps and
  mark the issue as **help wanted** or **invalid**. Until someone can reproduce
  the problem, they won't try to fix it.
- Once they can reproduce the problem, they'll assign it to someone to
  [implement a fix](#becoming-a-contributor). If you indicate interest in
  working on a fix, or that you already have a proposed fix, they may assign it
  to you.

## Suggesting enhancements

This section shows you how to submit an enhancement suggestion for Reliabot,
**including completely new features and minor improvements to existing
capabilities**. Following these guidelines helps others understand your
suggestion and how it relates to other approaches.

### Before suggesting an enhancement

- Make sure you are using the latest Reliabot version.
- Read the [documentation][2] to see if Reliabot can already do what you want.
- [Search the issues][4] to see if somebody already suggested this enhancement.
  If so, add a comment to that existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's
  up to you to make a strong case for the merits of this feature. Keep in mind
  that features should be useful to many users and not just a few of them.

### Writing a good enhancement suggestion

The Reliabot project tracks [enhancement suggestions][10] with GitHub issues.
To suggest an enhancement for Reliabot:

- [Create an issue using the enhancement template][11], labeling it as an 🔵
  **enhancement**.
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** to identify the enhancement.
- Describe any problem the enhancement would solve, and explain how.
- Provide a clear and concise **description of the suggested enhancement**.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain the behavior you'd like to
  see instead.** You can also describe alternative solutions that aren't as
  good, and explain why.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to many reliabot users.

## Becoming a contributor

> distribution under the [Reliabot project license][13],
>
> You do this by ["signing off" your commits][14]. "Signing off" isn't
> cryptographic, it's just a line like "Signed-off-by: your name
> <your.email@example.org>" at the end of a commit message. You can add it
> manually when squash merging a PR, or by giving the `-s` or `--signoff`
> option to `git commit`.

### First contributions

Unsure where to start contributing? Start by looking at Reliabot issues labeled
[**good first issue**][15] or [**help wanted**][16].

- **good first issue** – should only require a few lines of code and a test.
- **help wanted** – more complex, requiring code design and Python experience.

### Pre-commit setup

Reliabot uses [pre-commit][17] to perform lint and style checks and fixes.
Whether you are contributing code or documentation, [install pre-commit][18] on
your system, and then enable it for your local copy of the Reliabot repository:

```console
$ cd reliabot && pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

If you don't (or can't) install pre-commit on your system (say, if you're using
the GitHub file editor in the web UI to fix a small typo), once you create a
PR, the [pre-commit.ci][19] service runs the pre-commit checks for you and
pushes fixes to your PRs for many style / formatting issues. Run `git pull` on
your PR branch after the **pre-commit.ci - pr** checks are no longer pending,
and show either success or failure.

### Contributing code and bug fixes

When contributing new code or fixes for existing code, please add or enhance
the Reliabot code tests to cover the proposed changes. For a bug fix, add a
test that checks for the bug and only passes with the fix. For new features,
add new or extend existing tests to provide coverage and prevent regressions
from future code changes. Tests should fail with existing code, and pass with
your proposed changes.

#### Testing

The `reliabot.py` script integrates tests within itself as [doctests][20] in
module and function [docstrings][21], and the `__test__` map at the end of the
script. Put tests of bug fixes or corner cases for more thorough coverage in
the `__test__` map, keeping the function docstrings focused on explaining
typical use cases.

You can run these doctests with any Reliabot installation by running it with
the `--self-test` argument:

```console
reliabot$ reliabot/reliabot.py --self-test 2>/dev/null | tail -5
   1 tests in __main__.usage
   4 tests in __main__.validate_dependabot_config
147 tests in 41 items.
147 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.
```

The complete Reliabot test suite of Reliabot runs with `tox`. You can run them
with `make tests`, and install `tox` with `make tox` if you can't or don't want
to use your system's package manager to install it.

#### Linting and pre-commit checks

Reliabot uses an extensive set of linters and checkers to identify potential
problems with Python code. While developing code, you can run these at any time
with `pre-commit`. You can also run just one specific tool with a command like
`pre-commit run ruff` or `pre-commit run prospector`. The fast
[Ruff linter][22] runs most of the checks, but Reliabot also uses the much
slower Prospector to run Pylint checks, since many of those still aren't
implemented by Ruff.

Checks aren't always 100% accurate; there are cases where code needs to do
possibly questionable things. Most of the checkers allow you to suppress checks
for specific lines of code with comments like `# noqa: B123` (for Ruff) or
`# pylint: disable=some-code-smell` (for Pylint), and sometimes both may be
necessary for a single line.

### Improving the documentation

The documentation for Reliabot currently consists of a number of Markdown files
in standard locations (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md).

Reliabot's pre-commit configuration includes Markdown linters and formatters,
as well as a hook for [Vale][23] to review prose style and recommend changes.
Vale generates style errors, warnings, and suggestions. Only errors cause
pre-commit failures, but if there are errors, pre-commit also shows warnings
and suggestions.

To run it directly, use `make checks`, which always shows warnings and
suggestions. The Makefile rule for `checks` expects you to have already
installed Vale with `brew`, `choco`, or a Linux package manager. Alternately,
you can use `make vale` to install Vale with `pipx` and add its directory to
your PATH. You may need to run `rehash` or start a new shell or login to run
Vale after doing that the first time.

When contributing changes to the documentation, you must address any Vale
errors, and it's strongly recommended to address warnings as well. You don't
need to address suggestions, and any changes you make to do so shouldn't
sacrifice clarity or conciseness.

If Vale doesn't recognize a correctly spelled word, just add it to
`styles/config/vocabularies/Reliabot/accept.txt`. That file uses case-sensitive
regular expressions to accept words.

#### Code tests in Markdown documentation

A script wrapper for `doctest-cli` tests fenced code blocks with a `console`
language tag in Markdown files. It executes command lines following a prompt
(lines starting with non-whitespace followed by `$` and whitespace) and if
their output doesn't match the following lines in the code block, it fails.
When that happens, fix either the code or the documentation to match the other.
If you make changes to console fenced code blocks in the documentation, you
should run these tests using `tox -e doctest-cli`.

## Style guides

[Pre-commit checks](#pre-commit-setup) cover most of the style guides below,
and often auto-fix style issues, either as local changes in your copy of the
Reliabot repository, or as commits that pre-commit.ci adds to your PR.

### Commit messages

- Limit the first line to 72 or fewer characters.
- Start the first line with a [conventional commit type][24], like these
  examples: `feat:` or `ci(pre-commit):`.
  - _You can use [commitizen][25] or similar tools to help manage this._
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to…" not "Moves cursor to…").
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Python code

Reliabot code follows [Black][25] style formatting. Pre-commit checks enforce
this, along with various PEP code styles, using the much faster
[Ruff formatter][26].

### Shell code

Reliabot pre-commit hooks format shell scripts with `shfmt -i 2 -ci`, and lint
them with [`shellcheck`][17].

### Markdown documentation

Reliabot documentation uses GitHub Flavored Markdown, following the
[Markdown style guide][27] implemented by [Executable Books mdformat][28], with
some non-default `mdformat` style settings:

- "Consecutive" numbering for [ordered lists][29] for compatibility with the
  [markdownlint][30] checker, like this:
  ```markdown
  1. first
  2. second
  3. etcetera
  ```
- Word wrapping at 79 columns.
- A pre-commit hook based on a Python script from a [decade-old blog post][31]
  rewrites all [reference links][32] with numeric tags ordered by appearance in
  the text. This doesn't affect inline links like `[shell](#shell-code)`, used
  for any references to anchors in the same file but not anything else.

While these settings don't minimize Git diffs in line-by-line diff mode, they
do maximize readability of the Markdown source files, and the
`--word-diff=color` option for `git diff` generates usable diffs in most cases.

Reliabot uses several `mdformat` plugins to auto-generate tables of contents,
format Markdown tables, and to format code blocks with shell, Python, and
configuration language tags.

### Configuration files

Reliabot uses [Prettier][33] to automatically format CFG, INI, JSON, TOML, and
YAML configuration files. The only non-standard setting is to use single quotes
in preference to double quotes for formats that allow this.
