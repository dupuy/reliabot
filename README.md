# Reliabot ‚Äì Maintain GitHub Dependabot configuration

Reliabot is a tool that helps maintain Dependabot configurations in your GitHub
repository. This is especially helpful for [Terraform][1] ‚ÄúInfrastructure as
Code‚Äù repositories or any sort of "mono-repo" with many folders that may
require version updates.

<!-- mdformat-toc end -->

GitHub's [Dependabot][3] can [automatically update dependency versions][4] in
your GitHub repositories. Enabling version updates requires a `dependabot.yml`
configuration file in your repository. While creating this file isn't so hard,
in a large repository with multiple applications or types of code, it‚Äôs easy to
forget to keep the `dependabot.yml` configuration file up to date with newly
added or removed code.

The `reliabot` Python script and its pre‚Äëcommit hook can automatically maintain
Dependabot configurations, adding and removing entries in `dependabot.yml` as
you add or remove code in your repository.

You can run Reliabot directly to create a `dependabot.yml` configuration file
for your GitHub repository, but it's most convenient to run the reliabot hook
from the [pre‚Äëcommit][5] framework, or optionally, with the [pre-commit.ci][6]
continuous integration service.

## Installation

### From PyPI for direct use

Use `pip` to install the `reliabot` Python script on your system

```shell
pip install reliabot
```

#### Installing with RE2

You can improve the reliability and performance of Reliabot with Python RE2
regex support in its environment. This also requires the C++ RE2 library
(`brew install re2` or use Linux/BSD package tools to install `re`).

```shell
pip install 'reliabot[pyre2]'
```

Alternately, the `pyre2-wheels` extra, which depends on [pyre2-updated][7], may
work better, as it has pre-built wheels for many current platforms:

```shell
pip install 'reliabot[pyre2-wheels]'
```

Once installed, you can add the Python binary directory to your `PATH`.

### As a `pre-commit` hook

> Note: installation from PyPI is _not_ required for use as a `pre‚Äëcommit`
> hook. The `pre‚Äëcommit` command takes care of installing Reliabot in a Python
> virtual environment for executions from Git hooks or the `pre‚Äëcommit`
> command.

The [pre‚Äëcommit documentation][8] has detailed instructions for installing and
configuring `pre‚Äëcommit`. Once you have:

1. installed `pre‚Äëcommit`,

2. added a `.pre‚Äëcommit-config.yaml` configuration, for example by running:

   ```shell
   pre-commit sample-config > .pre-commit-config.yaml
   ```

   and

3. installed the Git hooks for your repository,

add the following to the `repos` entry in `.pre‚Äëcommit‚Äëconfig.yaml`
([Installing with RE2](#installing-with-re2) explains the motivation for the
`additional_dependencies` line, which also requires the C++ RE2 library):

```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/dupuy/reliabot
    rev: v0.1.0 # Specify any revision you want
    hooks:
      - id: reliabot
        additional_dependencies: [pyre2]  # or `pyre2-updated` or omit this line
```

After that, Reliabot runs automatically on any Git commit that involves
`dependabot.yml` or files where Dependabot could update their dependencies.

## Console script

The `reliabot` script takes a single argument: a Git repository path, and
creates or updates the `dependabot.yml` configuration file for the repository
based on the files tracked in Git, including both committed and staged files.

```console
$ reliabot .
Creating new configuration: './.github/dependabot.yml'
Updated './.github/dependabot.yml'
```

## Pre-commit hook

After installing and configuring pre‚Äëcommit with a Reliabot entry, you can run
Reliabot with `pre-commit run --all reliabot`. You'll rarely need to do so,
since any Git commit that could require an update to the Dependabot
configuration should invoke Reliabot automatically.

### Using with other pre-commit checks

If you also configure a YAML checker in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, it should
come before Reliabot. And if you configure a YAML formatter, it should come
after Reliabot. Pre-commit processes all hooks in the order they appear in the
configuration, and this order provides the best results:

1. YAML checker
2. Reliabot
3. YAML formatter

## FAQ

### Can I use Reliabot with Renovate?

No. [Renovate][9] detects all supported dependency information in repositories
and manages them unless `packageRules` configure it to ignore them, so Reliabot
functionality is not needed. [Renovate's configuration][10] is also very
complex, so it would be challenging to create a tool to manage it.

### Can I install Reliabot with Homebrew?

There is no [Homebrew][11] formula for Reliabot yet, but any contributions for
one are welcome.

### Can Reliabot generate a PR to update Dependabot configuration?

Generally, it is better to update the Dependabot configuration in the same PR
where dependency management changes are made, so Reliabot does not create PRs
itself. A GitHub Action could create a separate PR, and any contributions for
such an action are also welcome.

## Configuring Reliabot behavior

Reliabot uses the `ruamel.yaml` parser to read and write `dependabot.yml`,
preserving comments when updating it. You can add YAML comments starting with
`# reliabot:` to configure Reliabot and `ruamel.yaml` settings when updating
Dependabot configuration.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Important**: Reliabot only checks comments _after_ any explicit ‚Äúdocument
> start‚Äù line (`‚Äë‚Äë‚Äë`) and _before_ the first line with YAML data, such as
> `version: 2`.

### Keeping Dependabot configuration

If Reliabot removes your Dependabot configuration for a directory for any
reason, such as a new package ecosystem it doesn't yet support, you can prevent
that by adding a Reliabot comment with `keep=`_directory_ to `dependabot.yml`,
as in this example:

```
---
# reliabot: keep=example_dir
version: 2
```

This keeps Reliabot from removing any Dependabot configuration for
`example_dir`. To also keep Reliabot from removing configuration in
subdirectories of `example_dir`, use `keep=example_dir/`. To keep Reliabot from
removing _any_ Dependabot configuration in your repository, use `keep=/`.

> ‚≠êÔ∏è**Note**: A "keep" comment doesn't prevent Reliabot from _adding_
> Dependabot configuration for the directory.

### Ignoring directories for Reliabot

If Reliabot generates Dependabot configuration entries for directories that you
don't want Dependabot to update, you can prevent this by adding a Reliabot
comment with `ignore=`_directory_ to `dependabot.yml`:

```
# reliabot: ignore=testdir/example
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Important**: Reliabot **removes** any existing Dependabot configuration
> for ignored directories unless you turn that off with a matching "keep"
> comment, like the following:

```
# reliabot: ignore=archive/ keep=archive/
```

This prevents Reliabot from modifying any Dependabot configuration for
directories in or under the `archive` directory.

> ‚≠êÔ∏è**Note**: You can put Reliabot settings on separate lines or together.
> Multiple `ignore` and `keep` settings are combined, ignoring or keeping all
> matched directories.

### Reliabot directory matching

In addition to the special meaning of trailing `/`, Reliabot directory matching
supports some other special cases:

- The path `*` matches all subdirectories but not the root.
- The path `.` matches the root directory only.
- The path `/` matches all directories.
- Paths ending in `*` match as a prefix, but not exactly.
- Paths ending in `/*` match subdirectories only.
- Paths ending in `/` match the directory and all subdirectories.

Full details are in [the implementation][12].

### Indentation

Reliabot modifies the `ruamel.yaml` indentation settings to generate Dependabot
configuration that's mostly compatible with the `prettier` formatter. If you
prefer a different style, you can change the indentation with Reliabot comments
modifying `ruamel.yaml`‚Äôs `mapping`, `offset`, and `sequence` settings:

```
---
# reliabot: mapping=4
# reliabot: offset=2 sequence=4
```

> ‚≠êÔ∏è**Note**: When configuring indentation settings, choose values so that
> `sequence` > `offset` or Reliabot may fail.

The `ruamel.yaml` indentation settings are hard to explain or understand, but
this reformatted copy of an example from GitHub Docs may help:

```
# reliabot: mapping=9 offset=4 sequence=7
# Use `allow` to specify which dependencies to maintain

version: 2
updates:
    -  package-ecosystem: npm
       directory: /
       schedule:
                interval: weekly
       allow:
      # Allow updates for Lodash
           -  dependency-name: lodash
      # Allow updates for React and any packages starting "react"
           -  dependency-name: react*
```

- `offset` sets the indent for the `-` sequence indicator under `updates`:

  ```
  ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ-  package-ecosystem: npm
  ```

- `sequence` sets the indent for the values in the `updates` sequence,
  including the first item:

  ```
  ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ-‚éµ‚éµpackage-ecosystem: npm
  ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµdirectory: /
  ```

- `mapping` sets the indent for the values in the `schedule` mapping:

  ```
         schedule:
         ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµ‚éµinterval: weekly
  ```

If any indentation setting appears more than once, Reliabot uses the last one.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Important**: Indentation settings are **ignored** for comment lines,
> which keep whatever indentation they already had. If you change indentation
> settings, you may have to correct the indentation of comments, manually or
> with a YAML formatter. This is one reason YAML formatters in your
> `.pre-commit-config.yaml` should come _after_ Reliabot.

If you need more control of the formatting of your `.pre‚Äëcommit-config.yaml`
configuration file, this is best done by configuring pre-commit to use a
formatter like [prettier][13], the [Golang version of `yamlfmt`][14], or the
[Python version of `yamlfmt`][15] (which also uses `ruamel.yaml` and its
undocumented configuration settings for formatting).

> ‚õîÔ∏è**Warning**: Some combinations of indentation values can generate invalid
> YAML output that `ruamel.yaml` can't parse. Reliabot checks that it can parse
> the updated `dependabot.yml` contents; if not, it doesn't update the file and
> instead fails with an exit code of 3, printing an error message like the
> following:
>
> ```
> YAML (indent?) error: {'mapping': 2, 'offset': 2, 'sequence': 2}:
> while parsing a block collection ...
> ```

### Suppressing YAML start markers

YAML files can have a [‚Äúdocument start‚Äù line][16] with three hyphens (`---`)
before the YAML content of the file. This marks the start of a YAML document.
Although YAML checkers may complain if it's missing, it isn't required.
Reliabot adds this line to `dependabot.yml` if you leave it out‚Äîif that's a
problem, you can have Reliabot remove it instead, by adding a Reliabot comment
like the following at the start of `dependabot.yml`:

Reliabot always removes YAML ‚Äúdocument end‚Äù lines with three dots (`...`) at
the end of a `dependabot.yml` file as these files have no reason to use one.

```
# reliabot: yaml-start=off
```

If the YAML start setting appears more than once, Reliabot uses the last one.

### YAML version

The `ruamel.yaml` parser [follows the YAML 1.2 specification][17], but if you
need to use YAML 1.1 features you can do so by specifying the YAML version
before the document start marker, like this:

```
%YAML 1.1
---
```
