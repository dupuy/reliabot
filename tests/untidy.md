## Asking a question

> ðŸ’¡ If you have a Reliabot question, take a look at the [README][6] and its
> [FAQ][7] to see if it's answered there.

Before asking a question, search for [existing issues][
 8
] that are similar.

- [Create a new issue][9], labeling it as a **question**.

- To see if other users have experienced (and perhaps already solved) your
  problem, search the [bug tracker][10] for similar issues or errors.
- Reading the [documentation][6] can help. If you need help, consider just
  [asking a question][1] first.

- [Create an issue using the problem template][13]. It may not be clear yet
  whether it's a bug, so please don't label the issue.
